In this guide we jump into the functional aspect of *Channels*, *Authentication* and exchanging real time messages.

== Registering channels
The channels are registered inside `start/socket.js` file. You are free to register as many channels as you want and there is no linear overhead with the number of channels.

.start/socket.js
[source, js]
----
const Ws = use('Ws')

Ws.channel('news', ({ socket }) => {
  console.log('a new subscription for news topic')
})
----

The channel handler, very much like the Route handler receives a `context`. By default the context will have `socket` and `request` properties and more will be added by middleware like `Auth` and `Session`.

Once a subscription is made, you can use the `socket` instance to exchange messages.

[source, js]
----
socket.on('message', (data) => {
})

// emit events
socket.emit('message', 'Hello world')
socket.emit('typing', true)
----

=== Dynamic topics
You can also define channels, which can accept subscriptions for dynamic topics. Let's see the following example.

[source, js]
----
Ws.channel('chat:*', ({ socket }) => {
  console.log(socket.topic)
})
----

The `*` indicates that channel can accept any words after the static keyword. Continuing with the chat example, you can create a multiroom chat just using one channel.

==== client
[source, js]
----
const watercooler = ws.subscribe('chat:watercooler')
const intro = ws.subscribe('chat:intro')
const news = ws.subscribe('chat:news')
----

Now we have made three subscriptions with different topics, but all pointing to the same channel. When we will emit events, they will be delivered to specific topics only.

== Registering middleware
The middleware are registered inside `start/wsKernel.js` file. The same HTTP pattern is followed to register global and named middleware.

.start/wsKernel.js
[source, js]
----
const globalMiddleware = [
  'Adonis/Middleware/Session',
  'Adonis/Middleware/AuthInit'
]

const namedMiddleware = {
  auth: 'Adonis/Middleware/Auth'
}
----

And then use the named middleware on any channel.

[source, js]
----
Ws
  .channel('chat', 'ChatController')
  .middleware(['auth'])
----

== Creating middleware
When creating your own middleware, you need to define `wsHandle` method on it. Which also means, that you can re-use the same class for Http and Websocket middleware.

[source, js]
----
class CustomMiddleware {
  // for http
  async handle (ctx, next) {
  }

  // for ws
  async wsHandle (ctx, next) {
  }
}
----

== Socket API

=== Events
The following events are reserved and must not be used.

==== error
Invoked when an error is received

[source, js]
----
socket.on('error', () => {
})
----

==== close
Invoked when subscription is closed.

[source, js]
----
socket.on('close', () => {
})
----

=== Methods
Below is the list of methods you can call on the socket instance.

==== emit(event, data, [ackCallback])
Emit event to the connected client. This method will only send message to your own connection.

[source, js]
----
socket.emit('id', socket.id)
----

==== broadcast(event, data, [ackCallback])
Emit event to everyone except yourself

[source, js]
----
socket.broadcast('message', 'hello everyone!')
----

==== broadcastToAll(event, data, [ackCallback])
Emit event to everyone including yourself

[source, js]
----
socket.broadcastToAll('message', 'hello everyone!')
----

==== close()
Forcefully close subscription from server

[source, js]
----
socket.close()
----

=== Properties
Following are the read only properties you can access on the socket instance.

==== id
Socket unique id

[source, js]
----
socket.id
----

==== topic
The topic under which the subscription socket was created

[source, js]
----
socket.topic
----

==== connection
Reference to TCP connection, this connection is shared across multiple sockets for a single client for multiplexing.

[source, js]
----
socket.connection
----
